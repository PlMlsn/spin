Now, let's approach solving this problem differently. One potential initial guess could be obtained by solving a monosaturation problem where the control field intensity is the same for both spins, i.e., ϵ = 0, and then using homotopy to transition to ϵ = 01. We start by solving the problem for a single spin and then extend this approach to two identical spins before applying homotopy.","category":"page"},{"location":"bi-save.html#Homotopy-on-ϵ-:","page":"Saturation pair of spins and MRI","title":"Homotopy on ϵ :","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bi-save.html#Monosaturation-problem-:","page":"Saturation pair of spins and MRI","title":"Monosaturation problem :","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bi-save.html","page":"Saturation pair of spins and MRI","title":"Saturation pair of spins and MRI","text":"@def ocp begin\n    tf ∈ R, variable\n    t ∈ [0, tf], time\n    q = (y, z) ∈ R², state\n    u ∈ R, control\n    tf ≥ 0\n    -1 ≤ u(t) ≤ 1\n    q(0) == [0, 1] # North pole\n    q(tf) == [0, 0] # Center\n    q̇(t) == [(-Γ * y(t) - u(t) * z(t)),( γ * (1 - z(t)) + u(t) * y(t))]\n    tf → min\nend\nN = 100\nsol = solve(ocp, grid_size=N) \n# Extracting the control, final time and then duplicating the state to be able to have an initial guess for the two spins.\nu_init = sol.control  \nq_init(t) = [sol.state(t);
