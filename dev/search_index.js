Let us now solve this problem differently. One potential initial guess could be obtained by solving a monosaturation problem where the control field intensity is the same for both spins, i.e., ϵ = 0, and then using homotopy to transition to ϵ = 01. We start by solving the problem for a single spin and then extend this approach to two identical spins before applying homotopy.","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html#Homotopy-on-ϵ","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Homotopy on ϵ","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bisaturation.html#Monosaturation-problem","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Monosaturation problem","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"q₀ = [0, 1]\nocp = ocp1(q₀)\nN = 100\nsol = solve(ocp, grid_size=N) ","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"Now we extract the control, final time and then duplicate the state to be able to have an initial guess for the two spins.","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"u_init = sol.control  \nq_init(t) = [sol.state(t); sol.state(t)]\ntf_init = sol.variable","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html#Bi-saturation-problem","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation problem","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"ocp_0 = ocp2(q₀, q₀, 0)\ninit = (state=q_init, control=u_init, variable=tf_init)\nsol2 = solve(ocp_0 ; grid_size=N, init=init)","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"We define the function below that computes the problem depending on varepsilon: ","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"\nϵ₁ = 0\ninitial_guess = sol2\nL = [sol2]\nfor i in 1:10\n    global ϵ₁ = ϵ₁ + 0.01\n    ocpi = ocp2(q₀, q₀, ϵ₁)\n    sol_i = solve(ocpi, grid_size=100, display=false, init=initial_guess)\n    global L\n    push!(L, sol_i)\n    global initial_guess = sol_i\nend\nsol_eps = L[end]\nsol_eps.variable\nplot_sol(sol_eps)","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"Conclusion: The solution is a local one.","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"Another approach involves defining a bi-saturation problem with a slightly adjusted initial condition: q₀ = 01 09 01 09.","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html#Bi-Saturation-Problem:-initial-Guess-from-a-Slightly-Different-Problem","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-Saturation Problem: initial Guess from a Slightly Different Problem","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"ϵ = 0.1\nq₁₉ = [0.1, 0.9]\nocpu = ocp2(q₁₉, q₁₉, ϵ)\ninitial_g = solve(ocpu, grid_size=100)\nocpf = prob\nfor i in 1:10\n    global initial_g\n    solf = solve(ocpf, grid_size=i*100, init=initial_g)\n    initial_g = solf\nend\n# Plot the figures\nplot_sol(initial_g)","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"Conclusion: This solution is better that the two previous, which proves that these were strict local minimisers.","category":"page"},{"location":"bisaturation.html#References","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"bisaturation.html","page":"Bi-saturation (direct)","title":"Bi-saturation (direct)","text":"[1]: Bernard Bonnard, Olivier Cots, Jérémy Rouot, Thibaut Verron.
