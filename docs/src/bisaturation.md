# Saturation pair of spins and MRI
The problem we are trying to solve is the  $P_{BS}$ problem, also known as the *time minimal saturation problem of a pair of spin-1/2 particles* (or bi-saturation problem), as described on page 18 of the paper [^1] . This model describes a pair of spins that share the same characteristics, specifically the same relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. However, the control field intensity differs for each spin due to variations as they transition from the North Pole $N := (0,1)$ to the origin $O:=(0,0)$.
